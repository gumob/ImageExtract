<!--
### CocoaPods

To integrate ImageExtract into your project, add the following to your `Podfile`.

```ruby
platform :ios, '9.3'
use_frameworks!

pod 'ImageExtract'
```
-->

## Usage

Read the [usage](https://gumob.github.io/ImageExtract/usage.html) and the [API reference](https://gumob.github.io/ImageExtract/Classes/ImageExtract.html) for detailed information.

### Initialization

Just import ImageExtract framework:
```swift
import ImageExtract
```

### Synchronous and asynchronous request

Get the size of an image synchronously:
```swift
let url: String = "https://example.com/image.jpg"
let extractor: ImageExtract = ImageExtract()
let result: (size: CGSize, isFinished: Bool) = extractor.extract(url)
print(result.size) // (800.0, 600.0)
```

Get the size of an image asynchronously:
```swift
let url: String = "https://example.com/image.jpg"
let extractor: ImageExtract = ImageExtract()
extractor.extract(request) { (url: String?, size: CGSize, isFinished: Bool) in
    print(size) // (800.0, 600.0)
}
```
